# Arbitrary Web Bits  
**What is it?** A fun project to host short articles about the web and web development.  
**What does it do?** It's a website in development, currently hosted on GitHub Pages. I'm using it to showcase my HTML, CSS, JS knowledge.

----------  
## Features  
### Responsive web design  
- Developed for operation on mobile/tablet/desktop devices  
- Web Bits are made mobile first and grow to fit desktop viewports  

### JavaScript components  
- A newer web development practice for me: JavaScript.  
- I added the "home" and "pages" cards as WebBit components. They're rendered to the page using JS to add the card's HTML to the DOM.  

## Articles  
- Fun bits of knowledge you may/may not know or have seen before.
